[n8n](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n) is a workflow automation tool: you wire together triggers, apps, and code in a visual editor, and it runs them for you. This package runs it self-hosted against a local SQLite database, with telemetry off and a way back in if you lose the owner password.

## Image and Container Runtime

One upstream image, consumed unmodified.

| Property      | Value                      |
| ------------- | -------------------------- |
| Image         | `n8nio/n8n`                |
| Architectures | x86_64, aarch64            |
| Command       | The image's own entrypoint |

| Subcontainer | Purpose                                  |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `n8n-sub`    | The only daemon — the one to `attach` to |

One oneshot runs first: the volume arrives owned by root, and the image runs the application as an unprivileged user that has to own its own data directory.

**n8n is not open source.** It ships under the Sustainable Use License, which permits self-hosting for internal business purposes but is not an OSI licence — worth knowing before building a product on top of it.

## Volume and Data Layout

One volume, holding everything.

| Volume | Mount Point | Purpose                 |
| ------ | ----------- | ----------------------- |
| `main` | `/data`     | n8n's whole user folder |

| Path              | Written by  | Holds                                     |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `database.sqlite` | n8n         | Workflows, credentials, executions, users |
| `config`          | n8n         | The encryption key                        |
| `binaryData/`     | n8n         | Files that pass through workflows         |
| `config.json`     | The actions | The SMTP settings and the primary URL     |

**The encryption key is the important file.** Every credential in the database is encrypted with it, and it is generated on first start — so the database alone is not enough to recover anything. Both live on this volume, which is what makes the backup sufficient and also what makes it sensitive.

## File Models

One model, and it covers only what StartOS contributes.

| File          | Format | Modelled                | Written by  |
| ------------- | ------ | ----------------------- | ----------- |
| `config.json` | JSON   | Yes — `FileHelper.json` | The actions |

It holds the SMTP configuration and the primary URL, nothing else: n8n's own settings live in its database and are edited in the interface.

The model is seeded with SMTP disabled at install and merged on every later init, so a field added by a newer version picks up its default rather than being missing. `primaryUrl` is deliberately optional rather than defaulted — which addresses exist is not known until the interface has been exported, so it is filled in at init instead.

**Everything else n8n needs is passed as environment**, composed at start: the data directory, the port, the database type and path, the timezone, and the switches described below.

## Dependencies

None.

**But most workflows reach the internet**, since automating an external service means talking to it. n8n itself needs no other package here.

## Network Access and Interfaces

One interface.

| Interface | Id   | Type | Port | Description                             |
| --------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | --------------------------------------- |
| Web UI    | `ui` | ui   | 5678 | The workflow editor and everything else |

Bound on the `ui-multi` MultiHost over HTTP and not masked. **n8n's own login gates it**, and StartOS adds no gate of its own.

**The session cookie's `Secure` flag is deliberately turned off.** StartOS fronts the interface with its own reverse proxy and publishes addresses that a browser does not treat as secure origins; a `Secure` cookie would never be sent back over those, and the symptom would be a login that appears to succeed and then bounces straight back to the login screen.

**The URLs n8n hands out are set explicitly, not inferred.** Left alone, n8n composes them from `N8N_PROTOCOL`/`N8N_HOST`/`N8N_PORT`, which behind the StartOS proxy yields `http://localhost:5678` — correct inside the container and meaningless to an external service being handed a webhook, or to someone clicking a password-reset link. The package passes the chosen address as both `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL` and `N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL`.

`N8N_WEBHOOK_URL` is the current name; the older `WEBHOOK_URL` still works but makes n8n log a deprecation warning on every start. n8n normalizes each itself — appending a trailing slash to the webhook base, stripping one from the editor base — so the same raw address is correct for both.

**`N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL` reaches past the editor.** `/rest/settings` builds `urlBaseEditor`, `oauthCallbackUrls`, and `jwksUri` from one instance base URL, so the **OAuth Redirect URL** n8n tells you to register with Google, Slack, or any other OAuth provider is the primary URL plus `/rest/oauth2-credential/callback`. An OAuth credential can only be authorized if that address is one the provider can reach.

Which address that is comes from the **Set Primary URL** action. **A workflow triggered by an external service still needs an address that service can actually reach**, which remains a StartOS address decision: picking a `.local` address as primary does not make it reachable from the internet.

## Installation and First-Run Flow

Install seeds the configuration with SMTP disabled. There is no task and no credential generated here.

**The primary URL is seeded rather than asked for.** At every init the stored choice is checked against the addresses actually being published; if it is missing or no longer among them, a `.local` address is chosen, falling back to the first published address. That runs on install, on update, and after a restore onto a different server. It is deliberately silent — the alternative is leaving n8n handing out URLs it already knows are stale until someone answers a prompt.

**The owner account is created in the interface**, on first visit: n8n asks for an email address and a password, and that account owns the instance. Until it exists, the service is running and reachable but has nothing in it — and the password-reset action has nothing to reset.

The daemon carries a generous grace period, because a first start initializes the database and generates the encryption key before it answers.

## Actions

Three actions.

### Set Primary URL

Chooses which of the published addresses n8n treats as its own.

- **What it changes:** `primaryUrl` in the configuration, which becomes `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL` and `N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL`.
- **Cost:** the service restarts, since the value becomes environment.
- **Repeat safety:** idempotent, and pre-filled with the current choice. The options are read live from the interface, so an address added after install shows up without any further change.
- **Why it matters:** it is what makes a webhook URL copied out of the editor work when an external service calls it, what makes the OAuth Redirect URL n8n asks you to register with a provider a real address, and what makes the link in a password-reset email land somewhere real.

**An already-open editor tab keeps showing the old URL until it is reloaded.** The frontend hydrates `urlBaseWebhook`/`urlBaseEditor` into an in-memory store once at app initialization, guarded by an `initialized` flag, so a live tab never re-fetches them — and its hardcoded client-side fallback is `http://localhost:5678/`. The server is serving the new value immediately; only the loaded page is stale. A browser reload fixes it (signing out and back in does the same thing, by re-initializing the app, not because the session matters).

**Changing it is display-only — it never moves or unregisters an endpoint.** n8n stores no URL anywhere: an activated workflow writes a `WebhookEntity` keyed on `webhookPath` + `method` (no host, no scheme — its own comment describes the path as "appended to `${instanceUrl}/webhook/`"), and inbound requests are matched by `findWebhook(method, path)`, which takes no host. So a webhook keeps answering on **every** address StartOS publishes, the old one included, and active workflows are unaffected beyond the URL the editor prints.

**What does go stale is a copy of the old URL held somewhere else.** A URL handed to GitHub or Stripe last month is a string in that service's configuration; changing the primary URL changes what n8n shows from then on, and the external side has to be updated by hand.

### Configure SMTP

Points n8n at a mail server, either the one StartOS provides or one you supply.

- **What it changes:** the SMTP settings in the configuration.
- **Cost:** the service restarts, since the values become environment.
- **Repeat safety:** idempotent, and pre-filled with the current values.
- **Why it matters:** the "Forgot password" link on n8n's login screen sends mail. **Without SMTP that link cannot work**, which is what makes the next action necessary.

Choosing the system option uses the server's own SMTP settings, with an optional override of the From address.

### Reset Owner Password

Generates a new password for the owner account and shows it once.

- **For being locked out** with no SMTP configured.
- **What it changes:** only the owner's password. Workflows, credentials, and any other user accounts are untouched.
- **Cost:** none — no restart. It runs in a temporary container against the database directly, and n8n reads the hash on each login.
- **How it is done:** the password is hashed with **n8n's own bundled bcrypt**, taken from inside the image, so the stored format matches what n8n writes itself.
- **It fails loudly rather than guessing.** If no owner row exists yet, or if it would update more than one, it aborts and says so instead of writing something the application might not understand.
- **Runnable at any status**, including stopped.

## Tasks

None. This package raises no tasks, so the service is never held on a prompt and its ordinary controls are always available.

## Health Checks

One check, on the only daemon.

| Check     | Displayed as    | Method                    | Grace |
| --------- | --------------- | ------------------------- | ----- |
| `primary` | "Web Interface" | n8n's own health endpoint | 60s   |

It queries the application rather than probing the port, so it reports that n8n is actually serving.

**It says nothing about workflows.** A failing trigger, an expired credential, or an execution erroring on every run all show a green check; those are visible in n8n's own executions list.

## Backups and Restore

The `main` volume is copied wholesale — `sdk.Backups.ofVolumes('main')`. That is the database, the encryption key, and the binary data workflows have passed through.

**The backup is equivalent to every credential n8n holds.** The credentials are encrypted in the database, the key that decrypts them is on the same volume, and the backup contains both — which is exactly what makes a restore work.

A restored instance comes back with the same workflows, the same credentials, the same users, and its execution history. Anything that depended on the old address — a webhook URL registered with an external service — has to be re-pointed, since the address is the server's rather than the backup's.

## Limitations and Differences

1. **Not open source.** The Sustainable Use License allows self-hosting but restricts commercial redistribution.
2. **SQLite only.** The database type is fixed; there is no option to point n8n at PostgreSQL.
3. **Single instance.** No queue mode, no separate workers — executions run in the one process.
4. **The backup is as sensitive as the credentials**, because it contains the encryption key alongside them.
5. **Password reset needs either SMTP or the action.** There is no other way back into a locked-out instance.
6. **Telemetry, version notifications, and personalization prompts are turned off** by this package and are not switchable from the interface.
7. **Externally triggered workflows depend on the primary URL being reachable** by whoever triggers them — the package publishes the address you choose, but cannot make a LAN address routable from the internet.
8. **Changing the primary URL does not re-register existing webhooks** with the external services already holding the old URL.
9. **The timezone is fixed to UTC**, so schedules are expressed in UTC.
